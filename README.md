# Pricing-Algorithm-for-ISP

## Project Background
This is the code repository for the final project of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen's Spring 2025 course EIE3280. 

In response to the prevalent network congestion issues during peak hours (e.g., 10 PM to 1 AM) in campus networks, our team has proposed several simple Internet Service Provider (ISP) pricing algorithm strategies aimed at reducing network congestion ratio during specific time periods. These strategies include both dynamic pricing algorithms and static pricing algorithms. Detailed explanations will follow later.
